What the library does
---------------------

Fastlzlib is a zlib-like library created by Exalead SA., using FastLZ,
the lightning-fast lossless compression library written by Ariya Hidayat.

The API is nearly identical to the zlib one, and uses the same types and
error codes. The file "fastlzlib-zlib.h" can even be used for testing purpose,
to provide zlib compatible support to programs using it, without the need
of modifying the code.

Stream description
------------------

Streams are made of contiguous compressed blocks, terminated by an empty
compressed block (which is an EOF marker).

Each compressed block has an header at the begining, little endian, 

#define BLOCK_TYPE_RAW         (0xc0)
#define BLOCK_TYPE_COMPRESSED  (0x0c)

struct fastlzlib_header {
  Bytef magic[7];          /* "FastLZ\0" */
  Bytef type;              /* see BLOCK_TYPE_* */
  uInt compressed_size;    /* compressed size */
  uInt uncompressed_size;  /* uncompressed size */
  uInt block_size;         /* maximum uncompressed size ("block size") */
} fastlzlib_header;

The EOF marker is identified by compressed_size == 0 and uncompressed_size == 0.
The block_size member is constant for a given stream, and is only informational.

Immediately following the header, the compressed raw stream block.

struct fastlzlib_stream {
  fastlzlib_header header;
  Bytef compressed_data[]; /* 'compressed_size' bytes */
} fastlzlib_stream;

The complete block size is sizeof(fastlzlib_header) + compressed_size, and
sizeof(fastlzlib_header) == 20.

The header can be used to seek efficiently to a given uncompressed stream
position, by reading headers and skipping compressed data without reading it
until the desired block is reached.

RAW compressed stream description
---------------------------------

type == BLOCK_TYPE_RAW
The raw stream is uncompressed ; this type is used for blocks too small to be
compressed

type == BLOCK_TYPE_COMPRESSED
The raw stream is compressed using FastLZ. See FastLZ reference for more
information on the algorithm used.
